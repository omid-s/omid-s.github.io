# The Fascination 

 My fascination with cars started so early, as a kid, well, let's say all the toy cars in the world could not satisfy me. So I could not wait for a shampoo bottle or some thing like that to go empty so that I can jump in and turn that to a car as well. 

 Life gained way more colors when I learned I can use a bungee cord between the axle (called things that connect wheels then) and a hard place can act as engine. I am not sure if I could ever be that much waiting for some thing to break, but then it was a blessing; it meant i can open it up, make some thing out of it. 

My self education in electronics and mechanical concepts, as well as my working with my uncle on cars made me even more interested when I got older as well.


# The DIY 

 When I bought my first car, I made a habit of playing around it my self and fixing things, improving things here and there.
