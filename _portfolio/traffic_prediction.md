Predicting traffic trajectory and movement patterns helps improve road management and is also a component of autonomous driving vehicles. Using DeepLearning frameworks, we predicted car trajectories in traffic videos with 95% accuracy.

We used Tensorflow and Deep learning models, Image Processing Tools and clustering models to detect, segment, and track multiple objects with multiple trajectories in a same frame.
