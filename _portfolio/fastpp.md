This is a very high-performance log preprocessor and string-matching tool, beating state of the art -DFC- by 35$\%$, almost 5 times faster of that used in SNORT IDS and more than 10 times faster than ElasticLogStash. FastPP is designed to ingest logs of an enterprise network, reduce the records by filtering based on predefined patterns, and pass them to a storage module.
